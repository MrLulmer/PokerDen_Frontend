          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>The history of poker dates back to the late 18th century when the first game similar to poker was played by French colonialists in New Orleans. The game spread up the Mississippi River and out west during the Gold Rush. During the Civil War, it evolved with many additions. It gained a reputation as a "sinner’s game," later fueled by Hollywood’s Wild West depictions. Texas Hold’em, created in Robstown, Texas, during the early 1900s, remained obscure until its Las Vegas launch in the 1970s.</p>

          <h2>The Basics</h2>
          <p>Texas Hold’em is played with five community cards and two private cards (hole cards). Players aim to make the best possible five-card hand using these cards.</p>
